# Rally App
Volunteer management app for de-centralized non-profits.

## Dependencies
* [Twilio](https://github.com/twilio)
* [Material UI](https://github.com/mui-org)

## Running the project

You need **TWO** terminal windows/tabs for this (or some other plan for running two Node processes).
In one terminal, `cd` into `react-front-end`. Run `npm install` or `yarn` to install the dependencies. Then run `npm start` or `yarn start`, and go to `localhost:3000` in your browser.

In the other terminal, `cd` into `express-back-end`. Run `npm install` or `yarn` to install the dependencies, then `npm start` or `yarn start` to launch the server.

In the browser, you can click on the button and see the data get loaded.
