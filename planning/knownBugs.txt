-- A user can submit an application to an organization they're a part of,
  and if that application is rejected they are removed from the list of approved volunteers

-- Tasks are not sorted by date

-- Mark completed goes to tasks individual info page (unless that's intended?)

-- Managed / pending pages: does a user need "managed volunteers" button in the header & avatar,
    or is the "back to dashboard" enough?

-- In /organizations/ do we need both join + learn more buttons?
