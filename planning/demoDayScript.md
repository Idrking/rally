>If I wanted to apply to more organizations to give more of my time I can do so by clicking my organizations and appy to more organizations. All I need to do from here is select the organization and fill out the application form provided by the organization.
>I can even view the organizations webpage to find out more. Or reach out via phone or email

>If I am a user who owns a organization I can view the tasks and mark them as complete once they are done by the volunteers.

>I can even create a new task. 
>I also can manage my volunteers. I can see how many tasks they have completed or reach out to them via phone or email. 
> Another feature we have is to view pending volunteers to make sure that they have filled out the applications in good faith and the proper procedures can take place.
